# oqthemes

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A theme library for **orderlyquant** work (ggplot2, Rmarkdown, etc)

## Goals

- create a theme package that suits my aesthetic tastes and keeps
  me from fiddling around during data analysis
- become more familiar with the package creation process, including:
  - tests
  - documentation

## Background

- package development process followed the notes
  [here](https://www.notion.so/Snippets-fb64b41b178148e98ff94286e3c26619#59b119faf2164f79b30c41bf1837c461)
- heavily influenced by the package design of `hrbrthemes`
- also shaped by ideas found in `cr` and `tpltheme` from Connor Rothschild


## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("orderlyquant/oqthemes")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(oqthemes)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use
GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push.
An example workflow can be found
[here](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples).

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files,
so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
